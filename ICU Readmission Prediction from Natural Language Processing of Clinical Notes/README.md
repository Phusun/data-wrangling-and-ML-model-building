# Data preprocessing
ETL/ETLpyspark.py implements the data preprocessing and feature extraction with pretrained BERT model,
which was accomplished in Databricks(scala 2.2.0.)

WARNING: Without a GPU, it will take a long time to generate sequence and label dataset

You can easily download the generated train, validation and test data from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1inCZ5_rLTs5O8bQ_bm4sG7pBk3O7TobR?usp=sharing

# Model Training and Performance on Test Set:
- Generate or download pretrained feature matrices and labels in training, validation and testing set
- Place the data into processed/TF-IDF or processed/pretrained_BERT
	Under processed/pretrained_BERT, select one of these subfolders: 
		CNN_selectedCols_no_note_processing, 
		Mean_selectedCols_no_note_processing
		Mean_selectedCols_with_note_processing.
- Open /Code/Classification Model, run train_CNN.py and train_variable_RNN.py. Then will generate all plots related to:
	Training loss and accuracy
	Validation loss and accuracy
	Confusion matrix on test set
	AUC and ROC curve on test set
- Output folder will save the model generated by CNN called MyCNN.pth and one by variable RNN called MyVariableRNN.pth
